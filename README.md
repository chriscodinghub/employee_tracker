## Welcome to my employee_tracker!


## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.

+ I learned how to install dotenv and mysql and their dependancies.
+ I learned how to use SQL to manipulate server_db info.
+ I learned how to GET, POST and DELETE data from databases.
+ I learned how to use inquirer and convert user input into a db query.

## Functions of my App
+ Once the schema.sql and seeds.sql have been called.
+ The user can then call inquirer with node index.js within the powershell
+ Inquirer will then prompt the user with various options.
+ Depending on the selection of the user, multiple tasks will be carried out such as
+ Searching the departments, jobs or employees or
+ adding a new department, job or employee.


## Funny additionals
+ I completely mistook the requirements for this assignment and within the server.js file you will find that this app has almost fully functional web commands for users, each with unique SQL to carry out each task which I thouroughly tested via Insomnia.

## Future updates
+ I was unable to complete the final step which is editing a employees file, because I ran out of time. I spent approximately 15 hours creating all the data within the server.js file and because of my mistake, I was unfortunalty constrained by time to complete.
+ In the future I would like to add a PULL feature to allow users to edit their current files, as well as a DELETE/DESTROY feature.
